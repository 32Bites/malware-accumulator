# Malware Accumulator

Just a program I used to collect data for part of a school project comparing Malwarebytes and Microsoft Defender.

I may or may not turn this into some kind of utility, I have not decided.

## Running the program

You will need to install the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) compiler, in addition to the cargo ecosystem.
My recommended method for installing all of this software is using
[Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Next, sign up for a [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com/) account and obtain
an API key.

Then through your method of choice, set the environment variable `VTAPI` to your [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com/) API key.

After installing the required software and obtaining an API key, either clone or download this repository. If downloading this repository, extract the archive.

Upon the obtainment of the repository, enter your terminal emulator
of choice and change your directory to the repository directory.

Once you're within the repository directory, run the command `$ cargo run`, or `$ cargo run --release`. Both of these commands will download the dependencies, compile the program, and execute it. The second command is more optimized and is smaller, however, frankly, that's not exactly necessary for my purposes.

If you wish to change the number of samples that will be utilized in the [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com/) data collection, append a space followed by your number of choice (must be a natural number). For example, `$ cargo`` run 100` if I wanted to gather data on 100 of the scraped samples.
